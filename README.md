The dataset source https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set

The data revolves around a company called Dental Magic, and the core data set contains names, DOBs, age, gender, marital status, date of hire, reasons for termination, department, whether they are active or terminated, position title, pay rate, manager name, and performance score.

As an outside data consultant, Dental Magic has asked me to provide analysis to the following open ended questions:

1. Is there any relationship between who a person works for and their performance score?

In the Seaborn visualization you can see that many managers at Dental Magic have employees working under that that "fully meet" their employee scores. There isn't much of a relationship between who a person works for and their performance score. Although there are some points worth discussing:
 - Brandon Miller frequently has employees who exceed expectations with their employee score.
 - Michael Albert has several newer employees reporting to him and additional employees who need improvement.  

2. What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
Age is a big indicator with diversity within an organization. Dental Magic has a age is distributed pretty evenly thoughout the organization.

3. What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?
4. Can we predict who is going to terminate and who isn't? What level of accuracy can we achieve on this?

The dataset source https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set

The data revolves around a company called Dental Magic, and the core data set contains names, DOBs, age, gender, marital status, date of hire, reasons for termination, department, whether they are active or terminated, position title, pay rate, manager name, and performance score.

As an outside data consultant, Dental Magic has asked me to provide analysis to the following open ended questions:
1. Is there any relationship between who a person works for and their performance score?
2. What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
3. What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?
4. Can we predict who is going to terminate and who isn't? What level of accuracy can we achieve on this?
